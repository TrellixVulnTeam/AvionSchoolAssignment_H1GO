      <p>
        BTS (Korean: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan), also known as the
        Bangtan Boys, is a seven-member South Korean boy band that began
        formation in 2010 and debuted in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment. The
        septet—composed of RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V, and
        Jungkook—co-writes and co-produces much of their own output.
      </p>
      <p>
        Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to include a
        wide range of genres. Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social
        commentary, touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age
        youth, loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism.
        Their work features references to literature and psychological concepts
        and includes an alternative universe storyline. The group has released
        several albums and performed on several world tours.

          <dt>2010–2014: Formation and early years</dt>
          <dd>
            BTS began its formation in 2010 after Big Hit Entertainment CEO Bang
            Si-hyuk met with group leader RM and was impressed with his rapping.
            BTS was originally supposed to be a hip-hop group similar to YG
            Entertainment's 1TYM, but between their initial formation and their
            debut, Bang Si-hyuk decided that the contemporary youth needed
            instead "a hero who can lend them a shoulder to lean on, even
            without speaking a single word". The group was meant to debut in
            2011 and featured on several tracks by artists such as 2AM and Lee
            Seung-gi before their debut was postponed and the group was
            reorganized into a more traditional idol group. The lineup was then
            finalized with Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook in
            2012. Six months prior to their debut, they began to gain attention
            for their presence on various social media websites, as well as song
            covers on YouTube and SoundCloud
          </dd>

          <dt>2014–2015: Moderate success and first concert tour</dt>
          <dd>
            The last act of their "school trilogy", the EP Skool Luv Affair, was
            released in January 2014 and topped the Gaon Album Chart, selling
            100,000 copies in 2014 and over 250,000 copies overall. It also
            marked BTS’ first appearance on Billboard's World Albums Chart,
            peaking at number three. The album was supported by the singles "Boy
            in Luv" (Korean: 상남자; RR: Sang-namja) and "Just One Day" (Korean:
            하루만; RR: Haruman), which peaked at number 45 and number 149 in
            Korea, respectively. While Skool Luv Affair musically retained much
            of their hip-hop influences with the incorporation of R&B and hard
            rock, the album coincided with a thematic shift from dreams and
            happiness to love, focusing on school-age and youthful love.
            Following Skool Luv Affair's release, BTS made several appearances
            on Korean music shows and held their first fan meeting that March
            with an audience of 3,000 fans in Seoul. That July, BTS held their
            first concert in the United States in West Hollywood for free to an
            audience of 200 fans. In August, the group also made their first
            appearance at KCON in Los Angeles.

          <dt>2015–2016: Mainstream breakthrough and commercial success</dt>
          <dd>
            Shifting their sound and image from solely aggressive, masculine hip
            hop to more diverse styles, BTS wanted to express the beauty and
            anxiousness of "youth" and settled on the title of "花樣年華"
            (Korean: 화양연화; RR: Hwayangyeonhwa), loosely interpreted to
            define "youth" as "the most beautiful moment in life."Their third
            EP, The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 1 (March 2015), explored
            the growth and emotional agony of youth as well as its playful and
            uplifting sides. Fuse included it as the only Korean album on their
            list of the "27 Best Albums of 2015 So Far." The EP has sold over
            415,000 copies to date. Its lead single "I Need U" was BTS' first
            top five hit in Korea and garnered BTS first ever music show win on
            SBS MTV's The Show. While its second single, "Dope (Korean: 쩔어;
            RR: Jjeoreo)", only peaked at number 44 in Korea, it peaked at
            number three on Billboard's World Digital Songs Chart and became
            their first music video to accrue over 100 million views on YouTube
            in October.The group began the world tour extension of their Red
            Bullet Tour in June, titled 2015 Live Trilogy Episode II: The Red
            Bullet, visiting cities throughout Asia, Oceania, North America, and
            Latin America. Their fourth Japanese single, "For You", was released
            on June 17 to celebrate the first anniversary of their Japanese
            debut and topped Oricon's daily chart, selling over 42,000 copies
            within its first day. BTS later performed at Japan's Summer Sonic
            Festival on August 15 and 16.

          <dt>2017: International expansion and collaborations</dt>
          <dd>
            In February 2017, BTS released the repackaged edition of Wings
            (2016), entitled You Never Walk Alone. Pre-orders of the repackage
            reached over 700,000 copies, breaking the record for most albums
            sold in a month. The repackage included an additional four tracks
            that offered consolation and encouragement to its listeners. Its
            lead single, "Spring Day" (Korean: 봄날; RR: Bomnal) met critical
            praise as "an intelligent, compelling and elegantly restrained study
            of loss and longing" that "deliberately avoids cliché pomp and
            drama" by Dazed Digital. Embodying nostalgia and sorrow, it opened a
            new chapter in BTS' aesthetics and lyricism and attracted fans
            across generational boundaries. Upon release, "Spring Day" topped
            eight of the major South Korean online music charts, as well as
            Gaon, and crashed Melon's digital chart due to the high influx of
            user traffic. It also entered the U.S. Billboard's Bubbling Under
            Hot 100 singles chart at number 15 with "zero promotions."As
            evidence of its staying power, "Spring Day" is the longest-charting
            song on Melon to date. "Spring Day" later won Best Song of the Year
            at the 9th Melon Music Awards.

          <dt>2018: Worldwide recognition</dt>
          <dd>
            In the lead up to their next album, BTS released an original
            eight-episode documentary series exclusively on YouTube Premium
            entitled Burn the Stage that ran from March until May 2018, offering
            a behind-the-scenes look at the group's 2017 Wings Tour. In April,
            the group also released their third Japanese studio album, Face
            Yourself, which debuted at number 43 on the Billboard 200 as the
            third-highest-charting Japanese album in the history of the chart.
            In conjunction with the release of Face Yourself, the group released
            a nine-minute short film titled "Euphoria: Theme of Love Yourself:
            Wonder," which featured the song "Euphoria" and embodied the "起" or
            "beginning" of the narrative sequence.

            In February 2019, BTS attended the 61st Grammy Awards as award
            presenters. It was their first time attending the event following an
            appearance by the group at the LA Grammy Museum in 2018. In April,
            BTS became the first Asian act to surpass 5 billion streams on
            Spotify, and Time named them as one of Time 100's most influential
            people of 2019. Their sixth EP, Map of the Soul: Persona, was
            released on April 12 with the lead single "Boy with Luv" (Korean:
            작은 것들을 위한 시; RR: Jageun geotdeureul wihan si), featuring
            American singer Halsey.

          <dd>
            In January 2020, BTS released "Black Swan" along with a choreography
            art film performed by Slovenian-based MN Dance Company as the first
            single from their fourth Korean-language studio album, Map of the
            Soul: 7. Album distributor Dreamus reported that stock pre-orders of
            the album reached a record-breaking 4.02 million, breaking the
            previous record of 2.68 million held by Map of the Soul: Persona.
            "Black Swan" debuted at number 57 on the Billboard Hot 100 and
            number 46 on the UK Official Singles Chart. Later that month, BTS
            performed alongside Lil Nas X, Billy Ray Cyrus, Diplo and Nas at the
            62nd Annual Grammy Awards, making BTS the first Korean act to
            perform at the Grammys.
